(Lock Noise) #Door
Hey, Aya. You good? #You
... 
I...didnt mean what I said...you know, before. Well—I did—but not the way that I said it.  #You
And I shouldn't have thrown that plantain chip at your room...I'll pick that up.  #You
 If you're waiting for an apology, you wont—  #You
 (Scream) #Aya
 Aya? Aya! Open the damn door #You
 (Scream) #Aya
 Damn it! I'm breaking in! #You
