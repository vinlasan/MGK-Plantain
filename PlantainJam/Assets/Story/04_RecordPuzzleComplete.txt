You: We?

Theo:{color=#E63B2A} The people who have lived and loved in this home.{/color}

Theo:{color=#E63B2A} The lining between our world and yours thinned a few hours ago and we came like bees to honey.{/color}

Theo:{color=#E63B2A} You called to us.{wi} Left the door wide open with a spiritual welcome mat.{/color}

Theo:{color=#E63B2A} The door to the atrium should be open now.{/color}
