You know {wi}what you did.\nPretending like you care{wi} wont fix it.\nThey{wi} hurt {wi}you.

There isn't a difference between possession {wi}and moving into a home\n{wi}and not caring to learn its name\n{wi}or what it likes

Because{wi} homes are living things {wi}too\n{wi}and you cannot own living things

So,{wi}\n this home is family to us.

You say you want to protect your family, too.\n{wi}Okay.

But we both know that they will never protect {wi}you.
