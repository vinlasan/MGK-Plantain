You: How...

Spirit: My name is Theophilus. You can call me Theo.

You: Why are you in my body?

Theo: Because you don't want it.

You: I—No, I—that's not. You tricked me.

Theo: Don't worry. You're too strong for me to stay in it. Just need to borrow every now and then.

You: She's dead. Everyone is dead. I'm dead.

You: *sobs*

Theo: ...

Theo: ...

Theo: ...

Theo: You still have a couple hours before that inevitably happens, kid. Keep your chin up.

You: Screw you.

Theo: ...

Theo: You wont be able to stop them. They've been hungry for so long. 

Theo: I'll help you if you give me something.

You: Take whatever you want.

Theo: I don't want "whatever". Taste should do just fine.

Theo: Not the kind on your tongue, the kind in your soul.

Theo: Play me a song that I could put on at my club.  Cats usually wear sharp suits to my joint. 

Theo: But we ain't high-strung. We laugh and drink in clouds of smoke. 

Theo: We're all cool...by accident. Get it? That's what this song should be.

Theo: Give me something with a soft **piano**. Fluttering almost. Gotta tune your ear to hear it beating its keys.

Theo: The only **voice** I want to hear is the squeak of brass.

Theo: No **jittery** mess. It's after midnight. This is a classy joint.

Theo: Then we'll talk with our indoor voices. Ghost to person.

Theo: Here, take your body back, unless you want to stay like that.
