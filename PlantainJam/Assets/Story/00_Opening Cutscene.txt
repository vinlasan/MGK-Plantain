We are in Brooklyn. {wi}\nYou are a medium. {wi}\nYou have made a mistake.

In the house you live in,{wi} but don't live in, {wi}\nyou think your brokenness is special {wi}\nand it is. {wi}{i}(it isn't){/i} 

There is nothing wrong with being a common {wi}wound {wi}\nIt means the healing is common {wi}too 

When your family looks through you {wi}\ndo you become {wi}\nor disappear? 

When the people of the city look through what we made {wi}\ndo we become {wi}\nor disappear? 

When you truly love something, {wi}you have the right to destroy it. 

Wouldn't you agree? 

This will not end well for you 

It will all be over soon
